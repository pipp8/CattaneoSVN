#	typemap.dat
#
#	Use this file to define namespace prefix and type bindings for
#	the generated header files by the 'wsdl2h' tool.  typemap.dat is the
#	default file processed by 'wsdl2h' to customize its output. You can use
#	wsdl2h option -t to specify an alternate file.
#
#	XML namespace prefix bindings can be provided to override the default
#	choice of the ns1, ns2, ... prefixes generated by wsdl2h.  It is highly
#	recommended to provide namespace prefixes for your project's XML
#	namespaces. In this way, changes to the WSDL (or newer releases of
#	wsdl2h) will have a minimal impact on coding.
#	Bindings for namespace prefixes are of the form:
#		prefix = "URI"
#
#	Type bindings can by provided to bind XML schema types to C/C++ types
#	for your project.
#	Type bindings are of the form:
#		prefix__type = declaration | use | ptr-use
#	where 'declaration' introduces the type in the header file, 'use'
