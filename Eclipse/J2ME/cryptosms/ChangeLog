Release 20070526-1

Bugfixes:

* fixed usage of com.sun.* - those classes are now loaded via
Class.forName() allowing graceful workaround if the classes are
not available. This makes the application run on siemens mobiles.

* GUI routines cleanup and (partially) rewritten. A number of
potential deadlocks are now resolved.

Features:

* Using PushRegistry. If available the mobile starts the application 
if a new crypted sms arrives.
