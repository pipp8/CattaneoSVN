    J2SE SMS Message Connection Implementation.
    <P>
      Implementation classes for the SMS Message Connection layered
      on a <code>DatagramSocket</code> low level transport.
    </P>

    <P>
      A single class is shared by the J2ME client and the J2SE
      service to allow formatted messages to be transmitted
      across platforms.

      <code>com.sun.midp.io.j2me.sms.DatagramRecord</code> provides
      the interface to get/set fielded data packed into a
      binary datagram message.
    </P>
    <H2>Configuration File</H2>
    <P>
      Properties can be set in a configuration file called
      "connections.prop" in the current working dirctectory to
      over ride the built in default values for the target
      client host name and the datagram ports to use for sending
      and receiving datagrams from the test platform.
      A phone number may also be set in the configuration file 
      identifying the sender's address.
    </P>
    <P>
      Here is a sample connections.prop file that matches the 
      built in defaults.
    </P>
    <PRE>
DatagramHost=localhost
DatagramPortIn=12345
DatagramPortOut=54321
CBSPort=24680
PhoneNumber=+123456789
