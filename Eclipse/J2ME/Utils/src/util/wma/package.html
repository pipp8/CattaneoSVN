    WMA TCK Message Service.

    <P>
      This proposal is made in assumption that minimal requirement
      for WMA implementation is:

      <UL>
	<LI> ability to receive a Message from network </LI>
	<LI> ability to send a Message to network </LI>
      </UL>

      Abilities to send Message to network and ability to perform
      device-to-device exchange are optional.
    </P>

    <P>
      In this situation only possible way for TCK to test for
      sending/receiving messages is to require from implementation
      under test some J2SE-based Framework API that will provide
      functionality of "network-initiated send" and "network-side
      receive". "Roundtrip" tests, where device sends/receive Messages
      to itself, will not work for all expected WMA implementations.
    </P>

    <P>
      This document contains proposal on this framework API.  It is
      supposed to run on J2SE, it is ~= to WMA, located in
      com.sun.tck.wma package. All APIs, that are unnecessary for
      testing are stripped. These stripped APIs are:
    </P>

    <PRE>
	Connector.open*Stream
	Connector.open(String, ...) methods with
		more than one parameter
	MessageConnection.numberOfSegments
	MessageConnection.setMessageListener
	MessageListener

    </PRE>

    <P>
      The proposal does not contain javadoc comments,
      assuming that these will be copied from WMA spec.
    </P>

    <P>
      The API consists of set of interfaces with single entry point
      com.sun.tck.wma.Connector interface and it's method
      <code>open(String)</code>. Licensee (and RI) should provide
      implementation of these interfaces and specify name of class,
      implementing <CODE>com.sun.tck.wma.Connector</CODE> interface,
      to TCK.
    </P>
    <P>
      TCK will use distributed test framework then to test if Message,
      sent from device, can be received by the network and vice-versa.
    </P>
    <P>
      Possible problems with this approach:
    </P>
    <UL>
    
      <LI> extra requirement on RI to provide J2SE implementation
        of WMA for TCK testing purposes. This J2SE WMA implementation
        is dependent of RI's WMA implementation - message
        transport and formatting. The J2SE WMA implementation
        can be done by TCK team, but in this case synchronization
        should be supported of any changes in RI with J2SE WMA 
        implementation and TCK will need extra resources. </LI>

      <LI> Unreasonable requirement on licensee that is able to
	support "roundtrip" tests to provide J2SE implementation of
	WMA.  Note, that ~such API would be required if we do testing
        of mapping of WMA to underlying protocol, that we are not
        going to do, as I understand. </LI>

      <P>
	extra documentation efforts
	
      </P>
      
    </UL>
