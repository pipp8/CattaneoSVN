    abstract = {Mobile devices are among the most disruptive technologies of the last years, gaining even more diffusion and success in the daily life of a wide range of people categories. Unfortunately, while the number of mobile devices implicated in crime activities is relevant and growing, the capability to perform the forensic analysis of such devices is limited both by technological and methodological problems. In this paper, we focus on {Anti-Forensic} techniques applied to mobile devices, presenting some fully automated instances of such techniques to Android devices. Furthermore, we tested the effectiveness of such techniques versus both the cursory examination of the device and some acquisition tools.},

Drawing on their extensive experience with mobile and wireless development, Shane Conder and Lauren Darcey cover everything you need to execute a successful Android project: from concept and design through coding, testing, packaging, and delivery. The authors explain how mobile development differs from conventional development, how Android differs from other mobile platforms, and how to take full advantage of Android’s unique features and capabilities. They present detailed, code-rich coverage of Android’s most important APIs, expert techniques for organizing development teams and managing Android projects, and dozens of time-saving tricks and pitfalls to avoid.}
